# Analyzing_Business_Data_SQL
About this course, I learned about 
  1. Revenue, cost, and profit, and how to use CTEs to combine the revenue and cost queries to calculate profit 
  2. User-centric methods, namely the registrations and active users KPIs, using window functions to calculate the active users growth and retention rates. 
  3. Unit economics, and understood how your data is distributed through histograms and percentiles. 
  4. How to produce an executive report using pivoting.
Right now, i can analyze the business case in sql
